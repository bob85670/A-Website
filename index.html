            For this programming project, you are going to implement a web proxy
            server. This proxy server gets request messages from clients (web
            browsers), forwards the requests to target web server or another
            proxy server, obtains the corresponding response messages and sends
            the responses back to the clients. This proxy server should be able
            to handle all kinds of objects, not just HTML pages, but also images
            and audio files. Moreover, this proxy server should support
            persistent connections; a timeout timer should be used to terminate
            idle connection from client. To reduce the complexity of this
            programming project, the proxy server does not support caching
            mechanism.

              how to implement a standard networking protocol.

          <p>
            HTTP is the transfer protocol used throughout the WWW. The HTTP
            protocol is a request/response protocol. When a client opens a
            connection, it immediately sends its request for a file. The web
            server then responds with the file or an error message. Each
            interaction consists of one request and one reply. Both are
            MIME-like message (MIME: The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).
          </p>
          <p>
            Each request message includes a request line, a few header lines, a
            blank line, and the possible message body. Similar is the response
            message.
          </p>
          <code>
            Request-message = request-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [
            message-body ] <br />
            Response-message = status-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [
            message-body ]
          </code>
          <p>
            For example, here are the request/response messages sent by a web
            client (wget) to the server to download a web document:
          </p>

              Non-Persistent Connection and Persistent Connection
            </h4>
            <p>
              In HTTP 1.0, after the TCP connection was established, a single
              request was sent over and a single response was sent back. Then
              the TCP connection was released. Establishing a separate
              connection for each file request incurs expensive overhead. In
              view of this deficiency, HTTP 1.1 was designed to support
              persistent connections. In HTTP 1.1, it is possible to establish a
              TCP connection, sends a request and gets a response, and then
              sends additional requests and gets additional responses. Our proxy
              server should support persistent connections between web clients
              and itself as well as between itself and target web/proxy servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an HTTP 1.1 client sends multiple requests through a single
              connection, the server should send responses back in the same
              order as the requests – this is all it takes for a server to
              support persistent connections. The server should close a
              connection after the connection has been idle for long enough
              duration (not defined in the specification; usually set to 10 – 15
              seconds).

            You are going to write a simple concurrent HTTP proxy server
            (http_proxy) using C socket, which works as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The http_proxy server listens for connection requests from
              clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              When there is a new TCP connection request, the http_proxy server
              creates a new process** to handle the new connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              The new process sends any HTTP requests to the (origin/proxy)
              server and reads the server's reply.
            </li>
            <li>Then it sends the responses back to the requesting client.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <small>
              ** Instead of using multiple processes, you can implement a
              multiple threads proxy server; the http_proxy server creates one
              new thread to handle each connection.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Directly connect to target web (origin) server:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Extract the “Host: ” header line from the client request
                    message to get the target server name

                    Connect and send the request to target server on port 80

                    Connect and send the request to the specified proxy server

                </ul>

          <section>
            <h4 class="subsectionHeader">Persistent connections</h4>
            <p>
              With persistent connection, the proxy server leaves the connection
              open for serving more requests after handling a request. The
              server closes the connection as per the client instructs or if the
              timeout of idle connection has been reached. In order to let the
              client knows when is the end of a response message, all response
              messages on the persistent connection must have a self-defined
              message length using the Content-Length header field [except for
              the cases of dynamically generated web contents]. As our proxy
              server, in principle, is just a relay server, our proxy server
              does not need to handle that as the Content-Length headers should
              be generated by the origin servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              To terminate an idle client connection, the proxy server can
              simply close the TCP connection and the client browser should
              detect this situation automatically. Similarly, a client browser
              can terminate an idle persistent connection by closing the TCP
              connection; the proxy server should detect this situation and
              should handle this correctly.

            <h4 class="subsectionHeader">Support request types</h4>
            <p>
              For this programming project, HTTP requests generated by all test
              cases are GET request types. However, of unknown reasons, some
              browsers may generate POST requests under some situations (e.g.,
              Chrome browser).

            <h4 class="subsectionHeader">Caching proxy server</h4>
            <p>
              You are not required to implement the caching mechanism in this
              project. That means all requests received from the clients are
              forwarded to the target origin/proxy server without the needs to
              search the cache memory as well as manage the cache memory.

              How to start the HTTP proxy process
            </h4>
            <p>The http_proxy should be invoked as follow:</p>
            <code>./http_proxy myport [proxy_server:port]</code>
            <p>
              The 1<sup>st</sup> parameter – myport is the port number that the
              http_proxy is listening on. The 2<sup>nd</sup> parameter –
              proxy_server:port is an optional argument. When proxy_server:port
              is specified, all the HTTP requests (responses) should be
              forwarded to (received from) proxy_server. The port in
              proxy_server:port is the port number that the proxy_server is
              listening on.
